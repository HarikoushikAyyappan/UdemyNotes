Inversion of control:

In order to utilise the functionalities of a class,we need objects.

The Instance of an object is created using new keyword in java. But when we move onto pratical applications,
using new keyword is not effective.

So Spring makes the process easier using a concept called Inversion of Control where we give our control to spring for creating objects
and we are injecting those objects created using Dependency Injection depending on our requirement.
